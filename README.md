In Progress - 

Now Renders a square

Can now move the square around the screen with WSAD - Kinda slow movement speed though

Square now also Rotates on one axis constantly - May have to make it rotate in x direction only on keypress


TODO
=========
Working on getting basic animation on the square based on a timer
Changing colour dynamically ? (Maybe)
